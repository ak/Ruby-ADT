04 followed by 32-bit zero (00 00 00 00) seem to precede each new row of data.

Seems like for each column we have to know how long each data set is because there is no separator between data.

The actual data is stored at the end of the file. 
There is a header with unknown information followed by information about the columns.
There doesn't seem to be a footer

400 byte header

byte 33 in the header specifies the number of columns - the previous and following bytes also change when columns are added and removed but I don't know why.

column names follow header

Column names have a reserved 128 characters (bytes)  
column names are followed by 72 bytes of information about the column.

2 bytes after the 128 byte column name is the column type:
00 04 - character
00 0A - double
00 0B - integer
00 0C - shortint
00 14 - cicharacter
00 03 - date
00 0D - time
00 0E - timestamp
00 0F - autoinc

8th byte after 128 byte column name specifies the length in bytes
